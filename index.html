        <p>Doesn't this seem familiar? This color scheme? I swear I recognize it from somewhere. That's right! It's the color scheme for the original GameBoy!</p>
        <h2>Original GameBoy</h2>

        <p>The GameBoy is one of my favorite video game systems of all time! I have to admit, I spent most of my youth playing on a GameBoy Color, but I always loved the classic colors of the original GameBoy!</p>
        <p>My favorite game on the GameBoy was Pokemon Silver Version. The game was developed by a company called GameFreak. The game was a sequel to the iconic games Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Blue Version.</p>
        <p>For Pokemon Silver, the developers added around 100 brand new Pokemon and introduced players to an entirely new region to explore!</p>
        <p>Although the first games came out in 1996, the franchise is arguably bigger than ever today in 2022. There have been countless TV shows, video games, movies, books, and pieces of merchandise from the Pokemon world! The most recent video game just came out in January of this year and is receiving great early reviews!</p>
